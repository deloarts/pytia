**pytia** is a wrapper for the CATIA V5 api based on the **V5Automation.chm** help file. It provides some useful utilities and features for interacting with the api and a cli tool. This module only works with Windows.

> üîí This is currently a private repo.

Check out the pytia ecosystem:

- [pytia](https://github.com/deloarts/pytia): The heart of this project.

## 1 installation

### 1.1 system requirements

- Windows 10
- CATIA V5 6R-2017 or higher
- [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### 1.2 pip

To pip-install this module you need to have access to this repo (which you obviously have if you can read this README). You have then two options:

#### 1.2.1 access token

Create a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) for pip'ing it.

```powershell
python -m pip install git+https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/deloarts/pytia.git{VERSION}
```

Use your access token instead of *GITHUB_TOKEN*.
You can omit the *VERSION*-tag if you want to install the latest version.

#### 1.2.2 ssh

Create a [ssh key and add it to your github account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) for access. Make sure your ssh key is working:

```powershell
ssh -T git@github.com
```

```powershell
python -m pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/deloarts/pytia.git
```

If you're using poetry add this to you **pyproject.toml** file:

```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
pytia = { git = "ssh://git@github.com/deloarts/pytia.git", branch="main" }
```

### 1.3 setup

#### 1.3.1 environment variables

By default you don't have to add any environment variables to your system. The following table lists what they are used for. To add the environment variables to your system open the PowerShell and enter the command like this:

```powershell
set ENV_VAR=ENV_VALUE
```

| | ENV_VAR | ENV_VALUE | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | PYTIA_NO_PROPS | 0 or 1 | 0 | By default pytia will create user ref properties (pytia version, etc.) inside a CATPart/CATProduct. If you don't want this set this variable to 1. |
| 2 | PYTIA_IGNORE_BOM_ERROR | 0 or 1 | 0 | By default no errors are ignored. But the BOM export keeps failing you can try it again with this parameter set to 1. |

#### 1.3.2 catia environment file

For some utilities you may want to setup your CATIA environment file according to the following table:

| | ENV_VAR | ENV_VALUE | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | DEACTIVATE_SHEETMETAL_WARNING_AT_PART_OPEN | Yes | If you use a stack export and you have some parts designed in the sheet metal environment you may want to set this variable. Otherwise you will get a warning at every opening of an sheet metal part document. |

## 2 usage

Once installed you can use **pytia** as a python module with a cli:

```powershell
python -m pytia
```

This generates the following output:

```plain
PYTIA 0.2.1

Usage: python -m pytia [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Command line tool for CATIA V5.

Options:
  --verbose  Show detailed logging info.
  --help     Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  bom     Exports the bill of material for the current product.
  box     Retrieves the bounding box for the current part.
  mirror  Creates a mirrored version of the current CATPart.
  new     Creates a new document (part or product).

See the full output in C:\Users\...\AppData\Local\Temp\pytia.log
```

### 2.1 commands

Above you can see all available commands:

- bom: *Exports the bill of material for the current product.*
- box: *Retrieves the bounding box for the current part.*
- mirror: *Creates a mirrored version of the current CATPart.*
- new: *Creates a new document (part or product).*

Use those commands the following way:

```powershell
python -m pytia box
```

This will create the following sample output:

```powershell
PYTIA 0.2.1

[ INFO ]  Bounding box of the current part:
          X = 100.0mm
          Y = 80.0mm
          Z = 20.0mm

See the full output in C:\Users\...\AppData\Local\Temp\pytia.log
```

### 2.2 options

Use an option to alter the behavior of the output:

- --verbose: *Prints the logging messages to standard output.*
- --help: *Shows helpful information.*

Those options can be used on a global level, or on a specific command:

```powershell
python -m pytia --verbose
```

```powershell
python -m pytia box --verbose
```

## 3 developing

For developing you would, additionally to the system requirements, need to install:

- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/#installation)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

> ‚ùóÔ∏è Never develop new features and fixes in the main branch!

### 3.1 clone the repo

Clone the repo to your local machine:

```powershell
cd $HOME
New-Item -Path '.\git\pytia' -ItemType Directory
cd .\git\pytia\
git clone git@github.com:deloarts/pytia.git
```

Or use GitHub Desktop.

### 3.2 poetry

#### 3.2.1 setup

If you prefer the environment inside the projects root, use:

```powershell
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure not to commit the virtual environment to GitHub. See [.gitignore](.gitignore) to find out which folders are ignored.

#### 3.2.2 install

Install all dependencies (assuming you are inside the projects root folder):

```powershell
poetry install
```

Check your active environment with:

```powershell
poetry env list
poetry env info
```

Update packages with:

```powershell
poetry update
```

#### 3.2.3 tests

Tests are done with pytest. For testing with poetry run:

```powershell
poetry run pytest
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Test discovery in VS Code only works when CATIA is running.

#### 3.2.4 build

```powershell
poetry build
```

This exports the module to the [dist](/dist/) folder.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure not to commit dev-builds (the dist folder isn't ignored, because this package isn't published on pip yet).

## 3.3 insides

### 3.3.1 framework

The [framework](/pytia/framework/) of this project is based on [pycatia](https://github.com/evereux/pycatia). If you only need basic access to CATIA with Python, without the wrapper and utilities this package provides, you may want to have a look at this repo.

### 3.3.2 wrapper

The [wrapper](/pytia/wrapper/) folder contains wrapping classes for the framework. Those classes provide basic needs, like checking for existing objects, creating objects, ...

### 3.3.3 helper

The [helper](/pytia/helper/) folder contains mainly helper functions for the wrapper and the utilities.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Some helper functions are currently a huge mess

### 3.3.4 utilities

The [utilities](/pytia/utilities/) folder provides utility functions which are intended to be used in other projects, like retrieving the bounding box of a part or exporting a bill of material.

Some utilities can be used as keyword arguments. To inspect it:

```powershell
python -m pytia --help
```

### 3.3.5 logging

You can use the [log.py](/pytia/log.py) module to log messages directly to the **pytia** logger:

```python
from pytia.log import log
log.info("This is an info log")
```

You can also use the predefined stream- and file-handler:

```python
log.add_stream_handler()
log.add_file_handler()
```

If you want to use your own logger you can access the **pytia** logger via its name:

```python
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger("pytia")
```

You can then add custom handlers and formats to the logger, so it fits your needs:

```python
formatter = logging.Formatter("%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s")
logger.setFormatter(formatter)
stream_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
stream_handler.setFormatter(formatter)
logger.addHandler(formatter)
```

### 3.3.6 exceptions

Pytia exceptions are defined in the [exceptions.py](/pytia/exceptions.py) file. All raised exceptions inside pytia have their roots here. All exceptions from this module will be logged to the **pytia** logger as error messages with a traceback.

### 3.4 pre-commit hooks

Don't forget to install the pre-commit hooks:

```powershell
pre-commit install
```

### 3.5 docs

Documentation is done with [pdoc3](https://pdoc3.github.io/pdoc/).

To update the documentation run:

```powershell
python -m pdoc --html --output-dir docs pytia
```

For preview run:

```powershell
python -m pdoc --http : pytia
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Creating the documentation requires CATIA to be running.
